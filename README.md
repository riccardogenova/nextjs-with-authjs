# Next.js 15 Authentication Example with Auth.js

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project demonstrating authentication integration using [Auth.js](https://authjs.dev). It provides an example of implementing GitHub and Google authentication in a Next.js application.

## Repository

This repository is publicly available at [https://github.com/riccardogenova/nextjs-with-authjs](https://github.com/riccardogenova/nextjs-with-authjs).

## Getting Started

### Installation

Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/riccardogenova/nextjs-with-authjs.git
cd nextjs-with-authjs
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

### Setup Environment

The only environment variable that is mandatory is the `AUTH_SECRET`. This is a random value used by the library to encrypt tokens and email verification hashes. You can generate one via the official Auth.js CLI by running:

```bash
npx auth secret
```

This will also add it to your `.env` file, respecting the framework conventions (e.g., Next.jsâ€™ `.env.local`).

In addition to `AUTH_SECRET`, you need to set up the following environment variables in your `.env.local` file at the root of your project:

```env
# GitHub OAuth
AUTH_GITHUB_ID=your-github-client-id
AUTH_GITHUB_SECRET=your-github-client-secret

# Google OAuth
AUTH_GOOGLE_ID=your-google-client-id
AUTH_GOOGLE_SECRET=your-google-client-secret

# Auth.js Secret
AUTH_SECRET=your-secret-key
```

For more information on obtaining the required credentials:

- [GitHub OAuth App Setup](https://docs.github.com/developers/apps/creating-an-oauth-app)
- [Google Cloud OAuth Setup](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials)

### Running the Development Server

Once the environment variables are set, start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the application.

## Features
